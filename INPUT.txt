Transcript:
(00:00) so that's the idea basically is like find Trends build a studio around it could be like micro apps basically I think micro apps are the angle again this you know when we break it down and that like simplified form sounds so obvious and so stupid but like really this is actually then like find Trends like that's like a very hard thing I think for the average person to do but I I think to that point like I think it's going to get easier and easier to see these trends that are occurring like and you can do that Trend analysis now at a
(00:27) level that just like previously was imposs and so you can also ship the product so quickly that you can actually ride that wave and I think that that again it just feels like there's something in there that's going to become more common and it's really like the larger Trend that's happening with like Ci and like the these other apps that do like that specific action that specific thing there's a ton like a ton of opportunity in those because there's just the to The Tam of that is huge
(00:53) right so the start time baby what are we doing today today we're doing I mean we're doing startup ideas but I want to give you the distribution as always come prepared right don't even come on the show if you're not doing it full disclosure we've both had four Cuban copies I'm wired right now we're wired all right what's idea number one okay uh do you know much about like Lightroom presets not really okay so it's like basically uh photographers use them to get like a certain style of the
(01:31) photo um so for example like if you want your wedding to have like a specific aesthetic right you'd go and use these presets um often like you know there's PE so there's this whole like economy around this too of people selling presets so like a lot of uh photographers this is what they do is they have these preset packs that you go and you buy from them uh so I think there's an opportunity to totally just erode this Market uh and basically turn it into to a subscription software for photographers so how you do this you can
(02:04) take a photo and you can get AI to create the XML that creates the Lightroom preset so imagine this I go in I upload the photo and I'm like write the code for whatever this Lightroom preset is so it gets the aesthetic okay so you can do that make these XML packets at scale right and then what I think you can do is then turn this into a subscription software where then you go and you're basically selling access to the say it's $29 a month you can make whatever preset you want you find a photo the aesthetic that you like and
(02:35) you're about to go do a shoot or whatever you're doing some edits you can basically upload that Source photo of the uh preset that you're looking for and it creates the the basically the plugin for you automatically download that Imports right into Lightroom and then suddenly you have that preset already to finded you don't have to play with so what this solves is instead of you can basically build whatever preset you want like using the AI uh image recognition so we messed around with this like two weeks ago saw that you
(03:04) could actually do this um huge market for this tons of search volume for like X preset right like X Lightroom preset um also you can Target people on Facebook ads that have a Photoshop or a Lightroom interest or an adobe interest and then you just run ads it's really similar actually to the SVG one that we talked about forever ago same idea where it's like here's the subculture of people that are buying these like you know um uh like pre-made whatever digital products let's just turn that into a subscription Revenue rather than
(03:34) having it be and this is something they use like on a weekly you know the daily basis when they're doing these edits they're constantly looking for them so the margin on that is like infinite I mean it's like 99% right like it's just the code also as the company like there's two sides of it so I think what you could do is you could have it where it's like uh the customer could upload the preset and build their own preset or you just have this library of presets that they can go and download just an
(03:58) XML file download and so then your job as like the company is you just go you scrape all the photo like I would probably find all the keywords that people are looking for like boho Lightroom presets right or whatever go find all the variations of the photos and then you take those build out the XML file and then people like have some for free like do like a 10 preset pack that's like a free download that gets their email put them into a drip nurture upselling them into the subscription I mean it's done Dude tell me believe this
(04:30) is a bad idea what if you bought a thousand domains boho Lightroom you you know where I'm going with this right yes 100% yeah so you buy the domain yep for the Search terms 100% so it comes up like number one on Google Quick fast 100% And then you just lead them to the subscription just funnel them into it into the company 1,000% cost what it's domain cost what now 10 bucks 10 bucks yeah you can get hosting or hosting I think you can do it's like an infinite amount of domains they charge on a bandwidth but you could just do like
(05:00) WordPress sites for all of them that's how all these seos do this totally how they um so basically there's a huge value for uh like injury lawyers um in all dud yeah like I always see their billbo I'm always like how do they make money well well actually that's how you think you're like how do I think about I'm like who are these people getting injured totally totally that's true how many people are getting injured that 80% of the Billboards I see in Miami totally are you know personal
(05:29) injur injury lawyer totally so anyway there's this whole quick break in the PO to tell you a little bit about startup Empire so startup Empire is my private membership where it's a bunch of people like me like you who want to build out their startup ideas now they're looking for content to help accelerate that they're looking for potential co-founders they're looking for uh tutorials from people like me to come in and tell them how do you you do email marketing how do you build an audience
(06:02) how do you go viral on Twitter all these different things that's exactly what startup Empire is and it's for people who want to start a startup but are looking for ideas or it's for people who have a startup but just they're not seeing the traction uh that they need so you can check out the link to Startup empire.
(06:24) co in the description basically so why this is a thing is because um to buy uh CPC ads or you know PBC ads on uh Law related keywords is super expensive like it's like you know for Miami it's probably $120 a click right for like truck injury lawyer um so what these uh seos do and then what these brands do or what these companies do is they're basically building an owned media asset that is a way for them to do like lead farming so they find every longtail keyword that's related to a brand uh or sorry that's related to like some uh uh
(06:57) uh you know search term that's like to this High ticket item that's like a onetime purchase and then they go they rank that they basically like Farm These leads in what happens is then uh they do what's called a rank and rent um so they basically like rent the site the leads of that site to a company and then often what happens is like after that company get sees the lead volume that's coming from the site they then go and they're like hey we want to buy this and like have it in our portfolio because then
(07:24) it's an asset this is like a you know asset line within the the the law firm right cuz they're like like oh we own like we'll say a portfolio of 50 domains that are constantly going to be uh sending leads to us is the idea so why this works is because longtail exact domains still actually work for ranking on Google with even all the algorithm changes and updates actually it's pretty insane so what Greg is talking about like oh you buy all these domain variations like boho Lightroom preset right or whatever the variation is um
(07:56) the opportunity there is that you can rank those domains really effectively so that creates this top of funnel if you have a thousand sites that are ranking for all these high intent keywords that just like funnels down into a single business and again you're just taking the same idea that the the law industry is using and applying it in this space and and law is just one of them like Med Spas are another um like anything that's like again High ticket um there there's opportunity there um there's probably
(08:23) there's a totally different world but uh uh in truck parking there's like a huge opportunity to do the same strategy um we looked at it at one point but anyway didn't move forward with it so Truck Part like only you just know that that opportunity exists I love you for that's why you're here okay so um I think one point on that I just want to I want to confirm with you if you end up building a portfolio of all these domains generating tons of leads that itself you can sell th% th% so like how much could
(08:56) you make in something like that like what kind of multiples huge depending on the industry um because like a lot of the people I know that do this um this that's their whole strategy they go and like basically they bundle these domains and they'll sell they sell them to a PE because it's it's just a you know it's think about it as like digital real estate you know it's like a real estate portfolio that your and your real estate is on the front page of Google right like that's the
(09:21) whole the whole concept but I mean it depending on the industry right like if you look at like a truck you know accident lead like you're talking about like 40 Grand Plus so think about okay wait so the lead is worth $40,000 yes that's like the value of this so like this is a Hu like this is a huge business like I'm talking like you know and the $10 million plus if you have like 50 domains that are in high like you know area uh like high population dense areas um and that's like the whole game The Challenge is that these domains
(09:50) that everybody knows this right so the what you have to do is like if you want to go byy you know say even like a a domain for like Kansas City or something right and it's like some long taale domain it's going to cost you like still a grand right so there is some type of like Capital up from investment that that domain isn't even being used for this it's just like domain squatters but the domain squatters know that they're valuable because of this whole ecosystem that exists around this and again
(10:13) there's we're just using the the lawyers because it's like one of the easiest ones but there's like hundreds of these categories right um and it's a lot of it is I mean even like CrossFit Gyms I seen them do this in the past where they own like all these longtail keywords that are related to that business hvat companies do this as well well it's just a lead like they're just lead like a lot of it's like local businesses that it's going to be in a physical location that you're searching for this so cool okay
(10:37) so I get this idea it's like on paper I'm like how doesn't this work someone's got to go build it to honestly find out um so we'll put a bow on that idea what do you got next next one I got for you uh is something a little bit different uh it's in the AI space as well but totally different category so it's in Ecom land um tons of search volume for AI for e-commerce newsletters AI for eCommerce newsletters going apeshit right now um and the I think the reason for it is like people
(11:14) just don't know what to include with how do you talk about your products like so op so I think that's one element the other uh the search intent that I'm also seeing forward is like they're looking for like basically how do I design these email newsletters um and we talked about this before like this like AI chat you know on S like imagine vzer but for Designing email newsletters I think that what it feels like there's people are looking for is basically hey I want to have like this predefined template but
(11:41) then I want to just like chat with the AI to like insert specific products so a lot of these uh e-commerce companies they they they still like hardcode these emails that they're building right like if you're legit you're you're doing all the design of these emails like you're writing all of this you know disgusting email code to like get you know it's just like tables within tables basically and so what you could do is I mean and this is I've literally done this work in like a past life where you would go into
(12:08) the email template and you would change like certain photos and sections and like I messed stuff up like countless times because you're again like tables within tables of programming occurring and like you know the the Link's not actually clickable and that's the whole point of this image being in there um so I think the angle is basically it's probably both uh the ability to modify a template that they already have for their email um uh like like the promotion of their products whatever their emails are that they send out uh
(12:38) through clavio or whatever and then also uh just like writing newsletters about like okay the holiday is coming up like what are some products that are related to this holiday and an angle that I can spin those in so that it tells like some type of like story narrative like say you're selling you know festive I don't know like Christmas mugs or whatever you know some some something like that it's how do I I mean I think one could be like identify the products in my catalog that are related to this this um uh you
(13:07) know event this time and and that that something is happening and then how do I write about that in the storytelling format um and kind of automate that process so I'm curious your thoughts there again I don't really know like this is just based off the search intent that I've seen but that I mean it's a growing keyword and I'm curious what you think on like how people what people are actually looking for I mean just curious okay on that idea like to be honest I don't know yeah um like the previous idea I was like yes I
(13:37) I see it yeah um I like 97% see it and and the last 3% you always kind of have to go and build it to totally to to really figure it out this idea feels like I If if I have you know to be honest I I prefer the the first idea the light idea um what do you think people are searching for with like AI for Ecom newsletters like why is that search volume like going up and like why are people cuz that's the thing that like also I'm like I don't know like I'm making a a guess like this is what I think people are looking for but like
(14:10) they're looking for something right and I think that's a lot of this is like I don't know what it is like that last 3% that you're were talking about like we think this is it I don't know if it's actually this but yeah I mean I don't know dude yeah like the the the reality is uh everyone's searching for AI for XYZ we know that um AI for e-commerce I see it m you know okay like you're that's a huge category that's a huge Niche but then you have the sub niche of AI for e-commerce newsletters
(14:44) and I'm like kind of like get out of here dude yeah I'm like that on one hand I want to look at it and and be like something is up like the trend data I don't know there's a bunch of bots that are just like search on the the ideas are these like weird ones right sound sounds so stupid the only reason I'm interested in this or like it like jumped out at me is so I had a friend that used to work at clavo and he's like yo 80% of the people that are using this aren't using it like they're paying for this but they're like
(15:18) not extracting all the value out of it and so it feels like some version of that and like again I don't know if this is an agent I don't know if this thing is just running in the back like I I don't know what this looks like but I feel like they know they need to do email marketing they have no and I I've been in the same you know situation like with with running uh like for email for an e-commerce company it's like what do you even say in this thing because you're just talking about the same
(15:42) products like over and over and over like how do I come from different angles every time so that it feels unique but I'm not trying to get the same end goal to happen totally um so I again I it it feels like there's something in there and it is a pain point cuz they're like I'm paying whatever you know a grand a month for this claim subscription you know 12 Grand a year and we're doing a send a month like that's not I I can extract so much more value from that what what what does that
(16:08) look like and I here's okay so here's my framework for coming up with ideas based on this idea and other ideas like it that I think could be absolutely massive so you pick a tool that high has high LTV like clavio what do you think an LTV of a clavio customer is I'm guessing I think they I think their averages they last around like 24 months um so I'm guessing like 25 Grand yeah so 25 Grand a hub spot 2550 Grand go to you know chat GPT type in high LTV SAS companies that have a market cap more than a billion dollars
(16:46) gives you a list so then you have all these softwares your Insight really smart 80% of people are paying for the software but not getting the most out of it really big Insight so then it becomes could you build a product I service that could eventually be like AI fully autonomous but a product I service that we're you know we help you get the most out of clavo I have I have something for you back off this do you know what s the software Sage is called like Sage 100 Sage 300 I know okay it is the biggest uh it's basically QuickBooks but for uh
(17:26) construction companies one of the biggest softwares in the world okay just full stop um massive so many companies use it because it's one of the biggest categories all right there is like tens of thousands of longtail keywords for how to XYZ and Sage 100 and Sage 300 it's all these different variations of the software they're doing the same thing Sage online I think there's massive agency opportunity to go in and basically be like we are the sage consulting company that comes in and it's literally like every construction
(18:04) company in the US uses this like that is your target market that you're going after and you're just basically building out you know what it's it's most likely workflows that you're doing for them or the same thing that you do in like HubSpot consulting or like Salesforce Consulting right where you build these custom dashboards out or whatever that ends up being um so again huge category there's probably a play Within uh plugins for that as well uh again they have a Marketplace of course they do um
(18:32) one of these massive companies um so just random uh I feel like that's related to like here's huge software that you know is underserved how do you go and you know provide some type of service within it totally so it sounds like it's find underserved software number one then it's build an agency productized agency turn that agency into product eyes agency then it's build templates digital assets sell them high margin 90 plus% margin and then it's can I you know add two plugins can I do you know custom Builds on top of
(19:09) this cuz suddenly you know how the API works way better than anybody else in the industry and you just found that the last 10 clients ask for the same thing can I do it you know a subscription version of this that's $100 instead of a th to to do this build out for them and the reality is that you build all those things you will be able to sell to HubSpot if you're building a HubSpot you know business or Sage or uh Shopify or whatever it is right they're going to if you could convince them that people who
(19:42) sign up to your service use their product more core product more core product more that's huge for them totally yeah and it makes a better experience on top of their software which creates like longer stickiness like yeah this is this is good yeah but uh so next one uh agent uh so piggyback off of exactly what we're talking about of a software that's growing have you heard of Lelo yet no okay uh VC company um growing like crazy they are a drop CRM is how they're positioning themselves um but they're
(20:13) doing like SMS they're doing email they do uh Instagram DMs I think they're moving into Tik Tok and all this it's basically how it functions like say I'm a Creator or I'm like a music artist so like for example Zach bran used them on his last tour has this huge list all the tickets drop they hit the whole list and you can also like do like you know if you're on the list you get special access or whatever that ends up being um all of the major record labels are switching to this right now the only
(20:38) reason I know this is because I do a little bit of work um out of Nashville with uh for my friend who's an artist and like they switched over everybody that's on his management company is now in the process of switching over I think there's a massive opportunity to go and build the LEL low agency um from the conversations I've had nobody knows how to get people onto these lists all I'm doing and what we're seeing success with we take their Instagram account and we do a a um a match audience uh to anybody
(21:08) that's engaged with the Instagram account so this is the artist that we're doing we then run an ad that is a giveaway ad so you know get a $100 worth of merch for free when you sign up so these people already have an interest in that person they so like we know that they're a fan and we are running a merch ad to them and we just run that continually just constantly and then at the end of each month now the winner and it turns into this repeatable thing we're getting people to sign up for like
(21:33) under a dollar on this right and so I which is crazy and then what you're basically doing is like the whole angle is like hey we we run that that whole playbook for you like we and and this is this continuous thing that's going and the angle of why it's continuous is you're constantly making like different ad variations different Crea testing different so where this can even get deeper is you can strategically go and be like hey we know that the tour next year is going to be in these locations I
(22:00) want to run the ads just to these locations so that we get a mailing list for those specific venues uh those specific locations where the artist is going to be this next year so that when those tickets drop boom I hit that entire audience right and I immediately get sales so you can be like very you know almost scalpel like in the targeting that you're doing on this so anyway I'm curious your thoughts and can't you personalize it yeah yeah yeah all of it so how would you how would you personalize it cuz I think that's that's
(22:30) what a lot of people don't realize that's happening right now in growth and marketing is like we' moved from like one size fit we're moving from one siiz fits-all marketing to you know personalized totally with AI so thinking about so two things there um the artist the ads like we do variations of the artist being like hey I'm doing a giveaway like you know click the link to blah BL whatever it is right um so you can do those variations um and then the other thing that you could do is because
(22:59) it's geography when you say doing those variations you mean I'm I'll pick your favorite artist uh Charlie Charlie XCX you know Charlie XCX for those of you who don't know Cody is literally no forget Super Fan the number one fan the top 1% you were the top you were the top one dude I love Charlie and all these bandwagon fans man they need a it's killing me get out of here I was at I was at her bat tour and they were like oh they like I was with my girlfriend they asked like who's the who's the fan
(23:36) and she's like oh he is and you know I look out a place there and the people that like ask this they're like oh yeah for sure I knew every lyric they knew maybe two songs so get out kills me anyways so you can take you're you're saying using AI you could use AI I think the artists would have like hesitancy with that from the brand standpoint what if we just had the artist do is like hey you know here's five different scripts um like just literally do a selfie video of you at a venue and just like read out the scripts
(24:08) uh you know whatever 20 seconds long and then we test all those variations against each other see which one has the cheapest CPC the cheapest sign up you know people giving their their phone number their contact information well just to just to speak to that for a second so okay maybe Charlie is doing the I I can just see your like heart drop whenever I say the word Charlie I I could Charlie records the script but the background could be you know if she if it's in Miami new variation yeah new variation right that that either stock stock video
(24:43) or AI generated I remember Nikita Nikita beer um you know with uh tbh and and gas his his viral social apps he was creating ads and content where he was focusing on high schools and in college campuses but you know I think what made his ads and content so effective was you know if you saw an ad for University of Alabama oh in the location that's oh that's brilliant right so he's targeting University of Alabama the background isn't just some random college campus it's you know uh Alabama quad or
(25:21) whatever totally something that's recognizable that the whole I guess like you know micro Community or that geography would know exists or high schools even right even like a you know a 500 300 200 person High School totally um they see that ad creative and they're like wow this is obviously a product for me specific for me totally so take that you know just to flesh that out even further so you take that you know the uh talent that they recorded the video we remove the background and be like uh I'm
(25:52) coming to your city it could be generic even um or change it right whatever do some lip sync but I'm coming to your city um I want to give away free tickets to you uh you know click the ad to learn more and it like shows the background of the place that they're at and then you do that Geo targeting that ad just runs to that specific location I mean you could probably get that sign up even lower these people already know they exist right like they're already bought in you're just trying to get them on that
(26:16) on this list which is like what do you offer them and again we're just seeing this you know Playbook of like merch givea away they already like this person like work really effectively for this what do you say to people who say building uh a startup in the music business is like a terrible idea I think yes and no um I think there's straight up an opportunity probably if you go and do like a web flow or web design agency that is specifically for artists every year they renew their website every album drop and like they're constantly
(26:49) doing updates and edits on it like you could I I know a dude that does this and it's like 2K a month he's on subscription right and it's terrible the experience is terrible really hard to get into that world but like once you get one then it's you get all of them because like all of them are you get the entire management team is typically what how this happens so like a management company right like they would go they manage 30 artists and like you get one of those artists and you provide a great
(27:14) experience like you're going to get every one of those artists is going to come you know back to you basically because there's all this cross talk that happens internally like on like whatever the strategies are that are happening like that's the whole point of the management company how they function now is they're almost like a you know a growth agency or like the the media team that's behind this this this artist so like the label isn't really doing that the label doesn't even know what's going
(27:35) on nobody knows what's going on but like specifically the label doesn't know what's going on um the the artists and the management company are becoming more and more of that like lever that actually pulls and makes difference for the for the for the music labels like am I am I they're like a bank yeah exactly that's all they turned into yeah so God bless him yeah paying all the bills all right cool uh so this is a this is a physical one but I'm just like okay so I just feel like it's like this is a huge Trend that's
(28:06) about to happen so that's why I'm bu before you even say this idea okay physical idea yeah would you ever start actually start a physical idea how should people be thinking about software versus physical right now yeah yeah yeah so I think software or like any of these digital companies it's great if you like if you're it's it's Cutthroat though right like you're playing against the world world I think that's the difference um whereas like these physical locations like or these
(28:32) physical businesses it's you're just competing against the people in your geography and like if there's a certain biology of that that you know demographic area or that sorry that geographic area like these can work really well and like the one I'm about to tell you is is that so this business is a dog park that has a bar in it obvious say less dude okay so I we we take our dog there days of the week uh just to like when we're clean the house and you know running the vacuum or whatever and we don't want him to like
(29:04) just be in the way and it's also like for him to get to hang out and you know have some social um so it's it's a boarding like daycare place the dog has to be okay to be in there if once they're okay they can go to the dog park there's a bar at the dog park at 400 pm. every day that bar is popping I'm talking like you're talking you know Peak 11:00 p.m.
(29:29)  like New Year's Eve like bar level of turns that are happening the whole thing it is insane and I think that there is a huge opportunity they just have it in like a warehouse that's like all like you know it's in this like industrial park that they put this thing in um there's nothing else out there besides really this this this facility and uh I I think it's massive the other side of it too that they do is they have this like app that throughout the day when they're watching the dog it like you they take photos of the dog and then they give
(30:00) like a play byplay of like what it's doing uh girlfriend is obsessed with it she Lo like she's like oh my God like I get this like it's almost like a feed of like hit you know their day basically so kind of two sides of of of like of a similar business but like I think specifically like dog park bar is just this massive massive opportunity just based on what I'm seeing so how do you actually go and start that I to I I that's where you're like I have no idea like getting the liquor license the
(30:31) whole thing like that's a huge lift this would have to be but you know somebody that knows that industry or knows that World um but I I think that that idea of like a place where I can take my dog that has like some type of social thing connected to it cuz they're charging for the dog and then for the drinks right so you're getting like the dog turn but then also like the drink turn it could even be a coffee shop or something as well but it's like oh the dog can play for two hours you drink two coffees or
(30:58) whatever you drink two drinks or three drink whatever that ends up being and the bigger thing is it's like this third space that people go to that they can meet up which is like everybody's looking for that that third space right now so a bigger thing uh on the marketing side super easy it's just Facebook ads to people who own dogs that's super super easy do like higher income you know 26 to 35 you're you're in the money but I think like a members only version of this could be really
(31:26) interesting totally agree yeah so like the trend is the soo House ification of everything y i I'm starting to see like the soo house but for um kids y like you bring your kids there totally um the so house for like people who play paddle totally um which is like an upcoming Trend so you basically you have the the macro trend of the so houstification of everything just country clubs yeah exactly Millennial Country Club Millennial country clubs are coming back you have they are though I think they are they are they're going to Rebrand
(32:02) too they need a re yeah exactly dues and then you Char you make money on uh on you know Hospitality it's such a like a repeat like again from how the how I understand the economics of these country clubs work like you have the dues you have to hit that amount if you don't they you still pay that money yeah it's crazy it's crazy like so you're like the the compan is guaranteeing they're going to get X dollar amount from you during that year right by the way it's not like they like hit you up
(32:29) and they're like by the way you haven't hit your limit and go spend $2,000 they're just like I hope Greg doesn't send them an email exactly and ask about this totally totally so but we have time for another let's do yeah let's do another let's do another idea okay cool uh next one for you um this one is more just like a larger Trend I'm starting to see with uh like very specific AI apps so like this uh AI app went viral recently it's like text behind image is is literally and so what what it is like
(33:06) for the audience is basically it's literally like here's a person there's a background behind them that's like beautiful and then they put like one-word text that's like you know Sunset it's so stupid well I think I think the use case is like YouTube thumbnails yeah that's that's one of the pieces yeah that what's what's uh I you had him on your Show recently I Daniel Dal yeah yeah yeah yeah he does that style amazing Yeah so basically what happened is I think this guy or
(33:33) girl saw this trend in YouTube thumbnail thumbnails and was like how do I make it really easy to do it productized it got a lot of traction 100% so I think that those like there's all of these very small things that people are trying to do like background removal or like Cloud removal and like all this stuff has kind of existed in some forms before and like all these like face tun apps and stuff like this but I think that there's and this is just like API rapper games that you could play but it's like okay we
(34:05) have this like app framework that's like text behind image like all that's happening there is like it's probably just an API call that's like putting this you know doing the separation and the whole thing um that could just be like reused over and over again for all of these like like small actions that people are trying to go viral with and how I'm seeing people price these is you basically buy like credit packs where it's like you know whatever four $4 a month and you get 10 credits a month or
(34:33) something but or a lot of the times it's like the classic you know app pricing where it's like $7 a week and it's like actually $29 a month that's what that's translating into right um but I think that uh no one talks about that by the way oh dude that's what is happening here and then they get three months out of it and they just got a $100 for you know an acquisition cost of like three bucks right cuz they're like oh you know I'll impulse all impulse by $799 you know where that started ringtones oh no way
(35:03) do you remember that yeah they're coming back I heard what yes I heard they're coming back I've heard that like there's this whole did your grandmother tell you that no dude this is like I think Sam par tweeted about it of how there's like these companies that are growing again and it's like a Nostalgia thing like selling Nostalgia of like you know I'm you put like a Britney ringtone on like toxic is what place people call you that is so funny dude amazing right like if I if I was hanging out with you and
(35:33) then all of a sudden Toxic by Britney Spears came straight up dude you you would be you would go up in my book I would be amazing right it would be and I think that that's it it's like a you know it's it's a it's a brand small price to pay for being cool with your friends exactly exactly and I think that that's back it it so anyway yeah I I don't know how we ended up in the re world but all roads lead to toxic VI Britney 1,000% the best karaoke song is sing by the way you want to get a crowd pumping
(36:03) it's like that or Sweet Caroline like those two will get everybody hyped how did we get here I have no idea Raa you know we got you got here Jordan you know we got here text behind image text behind image was it let's go so yeah I think that that is the angle I think you could just ride these ways and actually like this like you know you have a app framework that you're just like replacing the guts each time I think that this is what's going to happen with a lot of these like startup Studios um and I think this is
(36:37) actually a larger Trend where like if you even look behind you know the guys that are doing like cursor right or like any of these they're all like Labs like that's how they position themselves and how they're raising money like we're an AI lab or like we're a you know some we're almost they're like product Studios because it's like you know we have a 10 cracked engineers and we can push stuff out in like 24 hours right and I think that that that larger Trend at like different scales of the game are
(37:01) going to be happening more and more with because it's just so fast right like we're in this very Emeral media landscape and because of that like a trend can go viral for 90 days and it's like how do you ride that wave and I think that there's people that are doing this so that's the idea basically is like find Trends build a studio around it could be like micro apps basically I think micro apps are the angle again this you know when we break it down in that like simplified form sounds so
(37:26) obvious and so stupid but like really is actually then like find Trends like that's like a very hard thing I think for the average person to do but I I think to that point like I think it's going to get easier and easier to see these trends that are occurring like even the tools that I know you guys are building internally of like here's things that are popping off right like is there a way that we can inject or insert oursel into this and you can do that Trend analysis now at a level that just like previously was imposs and so
(37:53) you can also ship the product so quickly that you can actually ride that wave and I think that that yeah again it just feels like there's something in there that's going to become more common by the way someone listening this is going to be like yeah that's just like a small idea building these like micro apps but the reality is Adobe does this literally Adobe does this like if you they look for Search terms they create micro apps that funnels to their main apps yeah do you know V you know V right v.o they're
(38:20) like a online video editor company how do I spell that it's like v d. yeah I know them but yeah yeah so they launched a captions app for videos yeah um where you just like it's it's a standalone app away from their core product they also have like mobile full video editing it just does captions right it got to a million ARR and I think it was like 27 days if I remember right um and again they had an AUD like they had an email list and all these users already so like that that's how they can do that but like when you
(38:53) think about that like here's this app that does this one thing only but the audience is so big that you can go after like it's like even if you get a small percentage of it it's and it's really like the larger Trend that's happening with like Ci and like the these other apps that do like that specific action that specific thing there's a ton like a ton of opportunity in those because there's just the to The Tam of that is huge right so and I think that this is like a big Trend in all like everybody
(39:23) that's like you know go like well canva does this already or anything yeah like they do do this but like there's this subset of people that want to do this on their phone really easily right and they'll pay you for that right it's like it's just like you know looking at like people that pay like play Candy Crush as an example like majority of their revenue comes from like 10% of their users right but there's this subset of people that are willing to pay for this thing because they find Value in it so totally it's
(39:50) like and everybody had its photos like everybody takes photos like everybody is your damn it's like when you go to The Cheesecake Factory and you can order anything you know you know that's canv exactly and you're like God I don't even like I don't even know where to start I don't know what I want to do you like dude a friend of mine comes to Miami tells me that he's ordering a Cuban sandwich from Cheesecake Factory because it's on the menu it's like yeah you can order a Cuban sandwich
(40:27) from um Cheesecake Factory but you know you want to go to the place that has a menu of five things that has the best Cubano totally in town why do people buy from product I Services why do they buy from those types of companies it's because they specialize in this specific thing and because of that offering like they can just narrow down and focus right yeah and the positioning is tight oh totally you can wrap your mind around it right um and don't get me wrong like sometimes the experience of like when I
(40:53) go and I have that overwhelmedness like if you go to like a bomb Chinese like dim sum place like dude there's so many things on the menu like there's no way that like you're going to be able to but like that has its place but majority of the time people want to make less decisions so if you're like this app does this but there's like you know 360 million people that have mobile phones in the US that all could potentially want to do this thing there's a subset of those people that want to do that
(41:18) right and you're going to be able to find them now especially with like Facebook ad targeting has gotten ridiculous for app installs like I don't know if you guys have seen this where it's like we at the point where it's like if you just have enough money like you just Target all of Facebook with some type of conversion action and like it'll find the people like we're not even like don't even do the targeting just like tell them to like we want this action to happen send us traffic and
(41:42) then like you just run like 100 different variations of creative and it like finds that person insane insane when you think about that you know we're all talking about agents like it's like this brand new thing like isn't that's like an agent basically basically yeah yeah 100% my goal istion this action Y that is like the simple way of thinking about what an agent is totally I don't think people realize like how deep Facebook is on the AI stuff too like their entire ad platform is basically
(42:13) just AI right like that's how they're making all their decisions platform is AI and their news feed is ai% their their main product is AI 100% for consumers 100% and their main product for businesses is AI like how they not an AI company a th% they have more text information than the majority of them it's like higher quality T tradition like typically um in comparison to like shorter form because it's like more long form written content a lot of the time the whole thing so anyway I mean we we
(42:41) don't want to get too deep into that but on the the philosophical side of who's going to win this game but I I think it it's so obvious to me that like especially in like the ads like even with Google it's not that easy like I can just be like Google here's my action go find me keywords it's not really good at that like it can't do that really yet sort of you can like throw you know give it a landing page URL and we'll go and like extract the information but like a lot of the times like me in there like
(43:08) in that you know the dashboard like picking what we're actually bidding on we can get a better like performant uh convert like CPA than than what Google would find on it on its own um in contrast Facebook is like a lot of times dep again it depends on the budget size it but it can be better than us if the market is big enough like and there's some B2B like Tales cases where that's different where it's like oh this audience is only like 50,000 right like it's not going to we don't want to do
(43:38) all this ad spend to end up finding those 50,000 we'll just go after that 50,000 we'll we'll pay a higher CPC just because we know it's actually the Target customer but the you know if it's a product that sells to more than 30% of the US like just Global targeting and you're going to like it's going to find it faster than you'll ever be able to all right bro so I think that's the episode chilling you know thanks for having if you can't if you can't figure out how to make money from one of these
(44:09) ideas I don't know I don't know man you got it man honestly reach out ask questions in the comments man I'm I'm lurking there I'm happy I'll just drop a freaking loom video to you so we we'll be in the comments uh go check out Cody's podcast I don't really even know just I'm online I'm just do you'll see him Cody Schneider we'll put his links in the show notes um dude always good jamming with you g thanks for having me man stok to do IRL we out here I'll see you at
