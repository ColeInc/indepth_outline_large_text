Tonight, we are talking about excellence.

And if you have been a part of City Impact Church for any reasonable period of
time, you will know that we have manysauings that help us to define our
values.

And one of those sayings is:

Excellence without extravagance

In other words, doing the very best with what we have.

And | think that most would be able to see the evidence of this statement in
much of what we do as a Church.

As we strive to do the best with the resources that we haveavailable to us.

Now it’s true that not every Christian or Christian organization would
agree that we should be holdingexcellence as a value.

And there would definitely be some who feel that we go too far.
In fact, some may go as far as to say that we arematerialistic.

Over the years | have seen many people who have been drawn to Jesus Christ
and who have then become a part of the City Impact Church Family, because
they have seen excellence in what we do.

You may have also heard Pastor Peter make the statement that excellence
honour’s God’.

So, for the next 30 minutes or so I’d like us to take a look atexcellence and how
we should approach it as a Christian Leader.





DEFINING EXCELLENCE

Let’s start by defining excellence:
And | have 3 quick definitions taken from various dictionaries.

Firstly; excellence is defined as: The quality of being outstanding or
extremely good.

Another source states that: Excellence is defined as the condition of
being superior.

Yet another definition describes excellence as: the quality of excelling;
possessing good qualities in high degree.

So that’s how the dictionary defines excellence and that may be how you would
explain excellence if you were asked to do so.

Before we go any further, it’s important that we gain anunderstanding of
how the Bible defines excellence.

And to do this you need to understand that the word excellence is only
mentioned 5 times in the New Testament.

Philippians 4:8 (NLT) Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right,
and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and
worthy of praise.

1 Peter 2:9 (NASB) 9 But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy
nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the
excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous
light;

2 Peter 1:3-5 (NLT) By his divine power, God has given useverything we need for
living a godly life. We have receivedall of this by coming to know him, the one
who called us to himself by means of his marvellous glory and excellence. 4 And
because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and precious
promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and
escape the world’scorruption caused by human desires. ° In view of all this, make
every effort to respond to God’s promises. Supplementyour faith with a generous
provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge.




@ Now many would know that the New Testament was written in Greek, and the
Greek word for excellence is Arete

(Are et tay)

Which means:

A virtuous course of thought, feeling and action.Virtue, moral goodness.
Any particular moral excellence, as modesty, purity

So, as we can see, this kind of excellence has nothing to do with your
marketing.

Or how good your facilities look.

It has nothing to do with whether or not you are or have the best and brightest
equipment.

Or how well you do things or how slick your product is.

Rather it has everything to do with virtue and moral excellence.

It's about keeping your thought life pure.
Living right and striving to exist on the moral and ethical highground.

However, to the Greeks, the word arete meant, excellence and reaching one's
full potential.

It meant the perfecting of oneself, based on human ability and achievement.
In modern psychology this would be related to‘self-actualization’ or ‘self-
realization’.

Becoming the very best version of yourself that you can be.

Now obviously as a Christian our motivation for this kind of excellence is not
improvement for improvements sake.
But rather improvement because it pleases God and it reflects who He is.

Ultimately in context, this excellence boils down to moral self-improvement.
You striving to be the best moral version of yourself.

Which in itself is wonderful and necessary.

But that’s where many Christians stop.
Believing that excellence beyond their inner world, beyond their character,
beyond who they are as a person is vanity and materialistic.




DANIEL’S LIFE OF EXCELLENCE

@ So, let’s explore this a little further by looking at an example of excellence in
the Bible, from one of my favourite Bible characters — Daniel.

Daniel 6:3 (NKJV) Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the governors
and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king gave
thought to setting him over the whole realm.

Now here the word excellent is - Yatir (Yat-teer) which is aHebrew word, for
those who are interested.

And this word means:
Pre-eminent, surpassing, extreme, extraordinary, exceedingly,
extremely.

And interestingly it comes from a root word that means: Plenty.
This is about being the best of the best.

And in the NLT of Daniel 6:3 it speaks of Daniel’s great ability and that he
proved himself more capable than all the other administrators.

So, this excellence goes beyond virtue and our moral character (It’s not just
about being a great guy or a great girl).

This excellence spills out into how we use the giftings and the abilities
that we have been given.

How we function in our workplace.
How we operate our business.
How we lead in the Church.

How we perform on the sports field.

How we channel our creativity.

The first excellence that we spoke about tonight (Arete), was all about our
internal world.

Our character.
Our thought life.
Our inner self.
Which of course makes up who we are.



@ But this second form of excellence, is all about what we do.
And particularly, how we do what we do.

Here we see that Daniel’s excellence of character overflowed into
everything he did.

And in the book of Daniel chapter 10, after an extended period of fasting
an Angel appears to Daniel and listen tohow the Angel addresses him.

Daniel 10:11 (Amp) “O Daniel, you highly regarded andgreatly beloved
man,

This guy impressed God.

Not only that but because of the excellence in his life, Daniel served 5 successive
kings (And possibly even 6) because we don’t know anything about his role in
Jerusalem before he was taken captive.

All we know is that he was at least a member of a noble family or part of
the royal family itself.

Daniel also served in 2 and again possibly even 3 separatekingdoms as each
was overthrown by the other.

Some believe that his ministry spanned an impressive 69 years.

Think about that for a minute.

This guy was so good and so valuable to successive Kings and Kingdoms that
he literally couldn’t retire

JESUS DID EVERYTHING EXCELLENTLY

Now coming to the New Testament in Mark 7:37 this is what the crowd said
about Jesus:

Mark 7:37 (AMP) They were thoroughly astounded and completely
overwhelmed, saying, “He has done everything well! He even makes the deaf
hear and the mute speak!”

@ That word well in the Greek actually means: Excellently, nobly, and
commendably.

So | think that some people’s view of who Jesus was needs to change.

He was not a long-haired hippy who wandered through the land speaking in
riddles with his band of motley followers.

Jesus did everything excellently.

The Apostle Paul wrote in the book of Colossians 3:23-24:

Colossians 3:23-24 (Amp) Whatever you do [whatever your task may be], work
from the soul [that is, put in your very best effort], as [something done] for the
Lord and not for men.

So, if you’re going to do something — work hard at it.
But don’t just work hard at it — give it everything.

And don’t be afraid of being the best.
Don’t step back from excellence because you think that someone may
think that you’re just showing off.

QUICK RECAP

So, let’s do a little re-cap.

Firstly, we have internal excellence.

A moral, virtuous, character-based excellence that is driven the perspective of
wanting to be a better person who lives in line with the character of God.

And it’s this excellence which should lead us and even drive us to pursue
personal excellence.

An excellence that can be seen and admired by others in what we do.

And | don’t think that too many would have an issue withwhat | have said to
this point.

But the Bible shows us that excellence does not stop here.


GOD IS A GOD OF EXCELLENCE

In the creation account in the book of Genesis 1:31 it says:

Genesis 1:31 (NLT) Then God looked over all he had made, and he saw that it
was very good!

Now to be honest those words ‘very good’ don’t do this passage justice

at all.

So, let’s again go to the Hebrew which the Old Testamentwas predominantly
written in.

And here we find that the word ‘very’ actually means - Exceedingly.
And the word good means; you guessed it — excellent.
So Genesis 1:31 is actually a massive understatement.

What it should say is:
Genesis 1:31 Then God looked over all he had made, and he saw that it was
exceedingly excellent!

We know that God is many things.
Most of course would focus on 1 John 4:8 which tells us that God is Love.

1 John 4:8 (NLT) But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God
is love.

But we also have to understand that God is a God of excellence.
1 Timothy 4:4 (AMP) For everything God has created is good,

And again, | probably don’t have to say this, but that word ‘good’ in Greek
translates to:

Excellent in nature and characteristics, and therefore well adapted to its
ends.

So again, 1 Timothy 4:4 is actually saying: For everything God has created is:
Excellent in nature and characteristics, and therefore well adapted to its ends.

Creation itself is a reflection of God’s heart for excellence in the physical
world. And that’s ultimately the reason why excellence should be
important to us also because excellence flows from the character of God.

@ So, Excellence should start internally.
It should then flow to our personal lives and behaviours.
But then it has to flow to the physical world around us.
To our external world.

e And another great example of this is found in the book of 1 Kings when the
Queen of Sheba pays a visit to King Solomon.

1 Kings 10:1- 6 (NLT) 1When the queen of Sheba heard ofSolomon’s fame, which
brought honour to the name of the LORD, she came to test him with hard questions.
2 She arrived in Jerusalem with a large group of attendants and a great caravan of
camels loaded with spices, large quantities of gold, and precious jewels. When she
met with Solomon, she talked with him about everything she had on her mind.

3 Solomon had answers for all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to
explain to her. 4 When the queen of Sheba realized how very wise Solomon was, and
when she saw the palace, he had built, 5 she was overwhelmed. She was also
amazed at the food on his tables, the organization of his officials and their splendid
clothing, the cup-bearers, and the burnt offerings Solomon made at the Temple of the
LORD. © She exclaimed to the king, “Everything | heard in my country about your
achievements and wisdom is true! 7 | didn’t believe what was said until | arrived
here and saw it with my own eyes. In fact, | had not heard the half of it!

Your wisdom and prosperity are far beyond what | was told.

@ The Queen of Sheba was overwhelmed by Solomons’wisdom
(His Internal excellence).

She was also amazed by the organization in his Kingdom, his achievements
and his generosity in the form of burnt offerings to the Lord
(His Personal excellence).

e And finally, she couldn’t believe what she saw with regard to the prosperity of
his Kingdom and the splendour of all that he had built
(His External excellence).

@ This is a great example of how all 3 forms of excellence can work together.
But it’s this external excellence that many Christians struggle with.

And | can understand why some would think that way.

But what you have to realize is that the purpose of internal, personal and
external excellence is ultimately to bring glory to God.



1 Kings 10:1 (NLT) When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame,
which brought honour to the name of the LORD,

That’s why excellence in all three of these areas matters.
It's not so much about the what; but it has everything to do with the why and
the who.

Why we do what we do and who we do it for.

Which all boils down to our motivation.
When our motivation is right, then excellence shouldn’t be an issue for any
Christian.

However, we do need to be very aware that the pursuit of excellence has a
lot of pitfalls.

It’s ruined many good people and many good ministries.
But if our motivation is to bring honour to the name of the Lord then we are
on the right path to avoid those pitfalls.

Again, the starting point to success in this area has to be defining our
motivation.

Motivation is like a compass. It’s what keeps us on track.
It's what keeps us heading in the right direction through the storms of life.

Jesus love for God and for mankind was all the motivation, he needed to lay
down his life for us.

It's what kept Him on task.

Hebrews 12:2 (NLT) Because of the joy awaiting him, he endured the cross,
disregarding its shame.

The joy of being reunited with the Father.

The joy of knowing that His sacrifice would result in eternal life for all those
who accept it.

That desire to serve God and man, motivated and enabled him to finish what
God had asked Him to do.

So, our motivation has to be right and must be constantly checked, because it
will determine our destination and our success.

And that’s why | want to emphasize again, that our motivation in all things must
ultimately be to please God and bring honour to His name.



The Apostle Paul says in Galatians 1:10:

Galatians 1:10 (NLT) Obviously, I’m not trying to win the approval of people,
but of God. If pleasing people were mygoal, | would not be Christ’s servant.

So how do we practically work this out in our lives?
We understand what excellence is.
We know why we should pursue excellence in our lives.

But taking that what and why and coming up with the how.
Taking the theory and putting it into practice is always the tricky part.

So, in the few remaining moments that | have available to me, I’d like to focus
on some practical aspects to help you succeed in your pursuit of excellence by
avoiding the pitfalls along the way.

AVOIDING PITFALLS

Comparison

We need to understand that excellence is not a competition.

Our: Gifts, talents and callings are all unique.

And to compare their worth with another would be likecomparing a fighter

jet to a can opener.

Both have function.

And both have a purpose.

But they are very different.

| don’t know about you, but | wouldn’t want to go into battlewith a can opener.
But similarly what use is a fighter jet when you want to open a can of beans.

Biblical excellence teaches us that what we do has value to God and it is He
who decides if what we have done is pleasing or not.

Peer pressure
When we do what we do to please others.
Then those that we are trying to please will become ourjudges.

And their approval or disapproval will become the standard by which we
determine whether we have succeeded or failed.

Biblical excellence teaches us that as believers we are all accepted by God, and
that we all have value as his children, which is not determined by what we do.


Control

Biblical excellence teaches us that in whatever we do we are to put our whole
heart into it, understanding that ultimately the results are in God’s hands.

The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 3:6 says:

1 Corinthians 3:6 (NKJV) | planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.

So, as we do our best, we need to understand that it’s God’s responsibility to do
the rest.

Condemnation

We must always learn from our mistakes and then put them behind us rather
than allowing them to define who we are.

Proverbs 24:16 says:

Proverbs 24:16 (Passion) For the lovers of God may suffer adversity and stumble
seven times, but they will continue to rise over and over again. But the
unrighteous are brought down by just one calamity and will never be able to
rise again.

Remember that many of the greatest victories in the Bible followed directly
on from some of the darkest days in the lives of those God used.

God does not always build on the most successful people.
But He can build on those who are able to learn from their mistakes.
Biblical excellence teaches us that Mistakes are not the end.

But rather they are a step to enable us to learn and to grow.

Perfectionism

Excellence and perfection are not the same thing.
Perfectionism often drives people to set goals that areunreasonable

and at worst impossible resulting in disappointment and
discouragement.

The motivation behind perfectionism is often a fear of failure.

And the pursuit of perfection can lead to an over emphasis on mistakes and
failures, building a culture of criticism rather than encouragement.

We have to understand that perfection in this world is anunobtainable goal
which if pursued can lead to burnout.



The word perfect is used in the New Testament.

But the Greek meaning of the word speaks of: maturity, completeness,
being fully grown and in many places, it isreferring to the values of integrity
and virtue which is verydifferent to the worldly view of perfection.

Biblical excellence teaches us that when we do what we do for God, He is with
us.

In-fact He will never leave us.

He’ll be there when things go well.

And He'll be there when they don’t.

To: pick us up, encourage us and to help us learn from our mistakes.

Biblical excellence is about doing the best with what we have available to

us for God and with God.

Understanding that ultimately it is He who is in control and that it is He
who brings the increase.

FINISHING STATEMENT

So let me finish with this statement

You may not always succeed — But don’t let that stop you from giving
everything you do your very best. When you don’t succeed it doesn’t
mean that you’re a failure, and it doesn’t mean that you’re lacking
excellence. It may just mean that you were prepared to attempt
something that many others weren’t brave enough to try.
